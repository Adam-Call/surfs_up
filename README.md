## Overview

In this project we are providing a climate analysis of Hawaii, specifically looking at the island of Oahu during the months of June and December. Looking to see the differences in these months to provide an understanding in the different weather trends.

 ## Summary

 Average rainfall between these two months is moderate as well. With the difference between being 0.081. December is the colder and wetter of the two months. This could lead to a down turn in sales for that month however the overall climate is still very close to June.
