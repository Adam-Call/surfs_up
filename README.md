## Overview

In this project we are providing a climate analysis of Hawaii, specifically looking at the island of Oahu during the months of June and December. Looking to see the differences in these months to provide an understanding in the different weather trends. We are looking for warm, sunny weather to sell lots of ice cream and provide plenty of surf boards.

- June's max temperature is 85 F.
- June's minimum temperature is 64 F.
- June's max precipitation is 4.43.
- June's average precipitation is 0.136.
- December's average temperature is 71.04 F.
- December's max temperature is 85 F.
- Decembers's minimum is 56 F.
- December's max precipitation is 6.42.

 ## Summary

 The climate between June and December is actually very moderate. The average temperatures between these months is only 3.9 degrees fahrenheit. This warm weather will be perfect for selling lots of ice cream. 

 Average rainfall between these two months is moderate as well. With the difference between being 0.081. December is the colder and wetter of the two months. This could lead to a down turn in sales for that month however the overall climate is still very close to June.
